# Active Record Lite

- Library used for object-relational mapping of content pulled from database into Ruby objects
- Emphasizes use of metaprogramming and Ruby inheritance


I completed this project during my time at AppAcademy as a tool for obtaining deeper understanding of both databases and Rails. Understanding how backend frameworks actually work beneath the hood is definitely a big deal - particularly with Rails. Because Rails performs so many functions "magically," it's easy for a programmer to get a little lazy when using the framework. Building my own little Active Record helped prevent some of this reliance on a very specific set of tools.
